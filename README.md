DotNetControlsEx
================

This is a collection of .Net controls that I have found/modified and built.

All source that was found online contains a link to the original source for the control.

Controls include:
-----------------
- A slider control for selecting a range within a range of values
- Multiple collapsible panel controls
- Base controls that can be used to add double buffering to a custom control
